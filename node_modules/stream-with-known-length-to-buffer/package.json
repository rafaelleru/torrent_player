This whole package is 15 lines.\n\nThis module is used by [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io).\n\n### install\n\n```\nnpm install stream-with-known-length-to-buffer\n```\n\n### usage\n\n```js\nvar toBuffer = require('stream-with-known-length-to-buffer')\n\ntoBuffer(fs.createReadStream('file.txt'), 1000, function (err, buf) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err.message)\n  console.log(buf)\n})\n```\n\n### license\n\nMIT.
